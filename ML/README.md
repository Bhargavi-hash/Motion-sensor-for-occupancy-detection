## steps to perform prediction on the given input
1) download the files into a folder.
2) run predict.py/prediction.ipynb by giving pixel_matrix_list and corresponding pir_status as input to get the predicted number of people as output.

## Integration into Application
> 1) download ( prediction.ipynb and j_model.pkl ) or (predict.py and p_model.pkl) whichever u prefer into the same folder.
> 2) give the latest  pixel_matrix as list of lists and corresponding pir status as input in the prediction file.
> 3) get the no.of people as output from the prediction file.


## other details
> models are stored in j_model.pkl and p_model.pkl which are obtained by running training.ipynb and train.ipynb respectively.
